3D acoustically modelled voicebox for voice synthesis

This code is a work in progress and seeking contributors who specialise in 3D acoustic modelling.  This library is attempting to replicate the human voice through 3D acoustical modelling of the larynx, head and respiratory systems.

Unlike conventional TTS which is driven by text, this library is driven by motor functions (including emotional feedback) making it suitable for binding to 3D characters.

Hopefully, when complete, this will be the most natural library for voice synthesis available.

This code is released under GPL v3, but a commercial variant will be available also.
